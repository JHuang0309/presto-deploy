Below are some key aspects of our design choices:

- Consistent colour scheme. We utilised Tailwind CSS to ensure that buttons, forms and components are always visible and easily accessible.
- Icons such that users easily identify what certain buttons can be used for
- Alt text fields used on images to cater toward those that may be sight-impaired
- Overall consistent and aesthetic styling
- Intuitive laytout (e.g. back to dashboard button in top left of slide page)
- Buttons are made stackable on smaller screens.
- Separation of Actions: The "Cancel" and "Confirm" buttons are spaced apart to prevent accidental clicks. This separation helps users make a deliberate choice between actions.
- Significant actions such as "Apply" and "Confirm" are highlighted with clear contrast and distinct colours to guide the user through their options quickly.
- Tool bar is toggled to allow for greater mobile responsiveness and work on smaller screens.
